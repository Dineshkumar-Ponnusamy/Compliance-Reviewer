# Document: CAPA Investigation Summary (Excerpt)

## Incident Overview
- CAPA-ID: CAPA-2024-017
- Device: CardioWatch Firmware v3.2
- Trigger: Field complaint regarding missed atrial fibrillation alert on units shipped March 2024.

## Investigation Findings
1. Firmware build FW-3.2.4 introduced a debounce filter that suppressed arrhythmia flags shorter than 6 seconds (requirements specify 4 seconds).
2. Traceability audit revealed FR-3.2.1 and VR-7.5 were not revalidated after the firmware refactor.
3. Watchdog timer reset logs were missing for 18% of test cycles because logging occurred after reboot, violating IEC 62304 traceability practices.

## Containment Actions
- Quarantined lot CW-0324-17 (512 units) pending regression testing.
- Notified post-market surveillance team; no patient injuries reported to date.

## Corrective/Preventive Actions
1. Restore 4-second debounce threshold and add automated regression test to cover arrhythmia flag timing.
2. Update traceability matrix linking FR-3.2.1 and VR-7.5 to the revised verification evidence.
3. Relocate watchdog reset logging to pre-reboot hook; require proof-of-log in CI pipeline.
