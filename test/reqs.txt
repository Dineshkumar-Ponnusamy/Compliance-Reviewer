# Project: CardioWatch Firmware v3.2
# Document Type: Software Requirements Specification (Excerpt)

## 1. Functional Requirements
- FR-3.2.1 The firmware shall initiate ECG sampling
- FR-3.2.2 The firmware shall buffer ECG data in volatile memory before triggering lossless upload to the companion mobile app.
- FR-3.2.3 The system shall raise an alarm event if three consecutive uploads fail, logging timestamp, failure reason, and retry outcome.

## 2. Risk Control Requirements
- RC-4.1 The watchdog timer shall reset the acquisition module to mitigate missed arrhythmia detection.
- RC-4.2 Residual risk for data loss shall be accepted with supporting verification evidence.
- RC-4.3 All firmware updates must support deterministic rollback initiated by the Product Owner with audit trail.

## 3. Verification Requirements
- VR-7.5 The integration test suite shall cover cold-start recovery, watchdog resets, and concurrent BLE/USB transfers with pass/fail criteria.
- VR-7.6 Regression tests shall include simulated network outages up to 15 minutes with verification that buffered data is preserved.

## 4. Traceability Notes
- FR-3.2.2 traces to VR-7.6; verification evidence pending.
- RC-4.2 traces to VR-7.5; residual risk rationale incomplete in RMF spreadsheet.
